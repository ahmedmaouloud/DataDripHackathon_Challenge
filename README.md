# Data Drip Hachathon Challenge(Bank Customer Analytics Dashboard)

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project was developed for the DataDrip Hackathon. The goal was to act as a data analyst for a bank and build an interactive dashboard that provides deep insights into customer financial behavior, spending patterns, and segment performance to aid executive decision-making.

## 📊 Data Sources
We utilized the three provided datasets, merging them to create a unified view of the customer:
1.  **`users_data.csv`**: Demographic information (e.g., Customer ID, Age, Gender, Segment).
2.  **`transactions_data.csv`**: Records of financial transactions (e.g., Transaction ID, Customer ID, Date, Amount, Category).
3.  **`cards_data.csv`**: Details on bank products (e.g., Product ID, Product Name, Category).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
*   **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
*   **Data Visualization & Dashboard:** Power BI 
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 📈 Key Insights & Analysis Goals
Our dashboard is designed to answer critical business questions:

1.  **Customer Segmentation Analysis:** Who are our most valuable customers? How does spending behavior differ across age groups, genders, and customer segments?
2.  **Spending Behavior Analysis:** What are the most popular spending categories? Are there seasonal trends in transaction volumes and values?
3.  **Product Performance:** Which bank products are most associated with high-value customers? What is the product penetration across different segments?
4.  **Risk & Value Assessment:** Can we identify customers with high transaction volumes for potential cross-selling or those with unusual activity?
